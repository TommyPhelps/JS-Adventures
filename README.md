# JS-Adventures
A collection of all of my adventures in Javascript.

## Adventure 1: JSDrome

### Summary

This was a Palindrome that I created in JS. This was a fun project that
taught me how to reverse strings and how to test if one sting is
equal to another string. This was my first JavaScript project
that I made completely by myself so this was a wonderful experience!

## Adventure 2: BG-Color-Changer

### Summary

This was an interesting adventure. All I wanted to do was alter the
background color with JavaScript. The main issue I had was, I wrote 
the code and it seemed to be working, but it wasn't. I later found
out that all I had to do was wait for the HTML document to be fully
loaded before I executed the code. After I did this the code worked
flawlessly. One interesting thing I learned about this project was
how easy it was for me to manipulate CSS in JavaScript! I will definately
be using this knowledge in future programs when needed!

## Adventure 3: Form-Validation

### Summary

This was a really fun adventure. In this adventure I learned how to use
forms in HTML more and I also learned how to validate text which is 
something that I haven't done very often at all! I was surprised with
how simple it was to test if a value hasn't been entered! This is wonderful
to know for future endeavours in my programming journey!

## Adventure 4: Grade-Calculator

### Summary

This was an amazing learning experience for me. I sought out to do everything
myself with very little help from online sources and this was a great way to
solidify the fundamentals for me. I am getting a lot better at CSS and
Javascript this way. I can feel myself learning a lot more already. I am
excited for my future projects!

## Adventure 5: Goggle

### Summary

This was a great project to reinforce the skills I've aquired so far. I have
enjoyed the process of styling this page to replicate Google. I actually got
to do some work in Affinity Photo which was fun! This project was an absolute
blast the whole way through and I enjoyed every second of it!
